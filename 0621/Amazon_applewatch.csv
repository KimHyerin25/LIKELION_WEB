Nick M,"Volume on watch was to low to use on phone. Talking person on other end said was scratchy and couldnâ€™t understand me.  Used phone for everything. I seen on youtube two way conversations were clear and loud. This on i have tried everything to hear it was not to happen. Will try one more time today. I got it for phone and gps while driving and textIng when not near phone. . Just as easy to use phone  If volume wont be loud enough to hear. Will go back. Could just be this watch. Many for sale refurbished or renewed As they say.  Wanted one for so long. Not just now. Canâ€™t 5 star it cause itâ€™s not working for mine. I seen it work fine on 1 and 2. For speaker volume. seen it work on youtubealso make sure you want it. went thru hell on return, cant do return thro your orders, it makes you call cust service to reset watch. and they will generate ther eturn, its easier to drop it off a ups store, can return it that way. save all return info,, you'll need it..",2,"September 25, 2019",One person found this helpful
George Pytlik,"Replaced my wifeâ€™s old version 1 Apple Watch with this version 3 model. Great watch, but disappointed in the amount of memory. Apple updates always fail with the message that thereâ€™s not enough space to install the update despite having no music files and only minimal apps installed. It never occurred to me that the company would release a product that the average user couldnâ€™t update.",4,"December 21, 2020",2 people found this helpful
Jenni,"I decided to go with Series 3 because I had never owned a tracker before, and never worn a watch on the regular either.  So I wanted to make sure I A. Used the watch B. Didn't lose or break the watch.Overall this watch is great.  I like that it is connected to my phone and I can read texts, and see other notifications.  I love that it tracks my standing hours, calories burned, and exercise minutes.  This has helped bring awareness and helped me adjust my routine to make sure I am moving around, especially lately with working from home. My only complaint is sometimes it doesn't count that I am standing.  I have gotten the notification ""don't forget to stand"" as I am standing and cooking dinner, or standing in the bathroom doing my hair.  At first, it frustrated me, but now I just learn to not beat myself up if I don't get 12/12 hours standing.  In the future, if I were to buy a new watch, I would spend a bit more and get the watch with additional features that doesn't need to be within a radius of your cell phone.  That way I could leave my phone behind on certain occasions but still have the watch work.  Overall, for a first time Apple Watch (or any tracker watch) I would recommend this!",4,"May 22, 2020",0
AirbusMark,"I bought this watch primarily to monitor my heart rate and secondly because I already have an iPhone. First, this is a good ""smartwatch"" (gen 3). As a heart rate monitor, the watch is very slow to read your heart rate and turns the display off every time you put your hand down to walk or run. Trying to get a quick check of your heart rate while walking or hiking is a pain at best...Summary: If you're looking for a ""smartwatch"" and already have an iPhone, this is a good cheap(er) version (Gen 3). If you are more interested in a heart rate monitor, this is the wrong place to be looking...:(",2,"November 17, 2020",One person found this helpful
Emily,"This is my fault. I thought it would be compatible with my Google Pixel 3 XL and it was not. I wish it was. It has all the features I want. Other devices leave little to be desired for me personally. This has everything I want with excellent aesthetics to boot. I wish it was cross-platform. I filed for a return. I do highly recommend this product nonetheless. It would make for an all around excellent gift to anyone looking for Apple based tech to streamline and improve their lives.I was not compensated in any way for this review.

CraigV,"We have become an Apple product house (2 iPhones, 4 iPods, 2 iPads) and have loved these products.With my wife running, it made logical sense to purchase the Apple Watch Series 3 as it would offer seamless integration with her iPhone.The box is typical Apple. Simple, functional and everything is put in place perfectly. The phone came with some charge so it was ready to be used (did require a proper charger thereafter). Setting it up on Apple Watch app was easy, and she was ready to use it within minutes.It is light on her arm, doesn't cause excessive sweat when not being used during exercise, and is unobtrusive when being worn.I see the price has dropped a bit too, and it's worth picking up on the Series 4 if you can.",5,"May 22, 2019",3 people found this helpful
Amazon Customer,"So I just got this today, came wrapped in new packaging, watch was wrapped in all original plastic. So it is brand new. I love the features ESPECIALLY the walkie talkie! Works great! Sends texts as well as receives and answer and receive calls. I love that it connects to the phone via Bluetooth and it was easy! A lot to figure out but this is also my first Apple Watch so it will take some getting used to! The battery really isnâ€™t great though. I charged it after I got it (1pm) and around 9 it was at 19 percent.. that is terrible battery life! Still a great watch so far! Iâ€™ll definitely update in a month or so.",5,"January 4, 2021",One person found this helpful
Nikki,"Interesting watch. Not as much detail as the fitbit but it does have a customizable screen so you can see what you want on the screen instead of having to only use the phone.  Like the fact that I can answer calls with the watch, which is good when I happen to step away from the phone while it's charging and can still see the call. Just wish the battery life could be longer, but given what it does and how much it can be customized withe the different complications, I can see why it's a short charge hold.",4,"January 18, 2019",5 people found this helpful
misfitsailor,"Works reliably to make and answer calls.  No need to run to your phone when it rings.  The health app is awesome, I check the three rings to see if I am meeting my goals for standing, exercise and calories burnt.  The heart rate feature is useful also.  You can store music on the watch, but to play it back you need to use any bluetooth device.  (Although the Watch has a speaker, it is used only for phone calls)  Apple Watches are a little bit thick, but comfortable to wear.  The battery life is great!  You can go for a couple of days or more between charges, but I store mine on a charge stand every night.  I had got out of the habit of wearing watches, and I had my doubts about this watch.  However, I have found the Apple Watch to be quite useful and enjoyable life accessory.",5,"April 5, 2021",0
Boddiegirl,"Nice fitness tracker. Easy to accessorize. Good value.Not sure if itâ€™s me and I just havenâ€™t figured it out but, with my Fitbit I can track everything in the app without downloading additional apps. For example if I want to track my water intake I have to download an app, onto my Apple Watch.There are some nice features like texting and answering the phone. But I think those are available on Fitbit.Last I noticed my pace on the Apple is different from Fitbit. Thereâ€™s about a 3 minute pace difference. Thatâ€™s very significant ðŸ˜© Apple Watch has the slower pace.",5,"October 4, 2020",One person found this helpful
